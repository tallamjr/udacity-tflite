# Udacity's Introduction to TensorFlow Lite

> Course Structure
> In this course you will learn how to deploy TensorFlow lite models on Android, iOS, and IoT devices.
> This program is divided into 4 main lessons:

> Lesson 2 – Introduction to TensorFlow Lite

> Lesson 3 – TF Lite on Android

> Lesson 4 – TF Lite on iOS with Swift

> Lesson 5 – TF Lite on IoT

> Lesson 2 is aimed for all type of developers so that they learn how TensorFlow Lite works under the
> hood. We recommend everybody goes through lesson 2 regardless of their platform. The next 3 lessons
> (lessons 3, 4, and 5) are designed to be completely independent of each other and therefore, they
> all share similar sections that cover the same topics. Consequently, if you are an Android developer
> you can take lessons 2 and 3; if you are an iOS developer you can jump straight to lesson 4 after
> taking lesson 2; and if you are interested in deploying your models on the Raspberry Pi (or other
> IoT devices) you can jump straight to lesson 5 after taking lesson 2.

> We hope you enjoy this course!

> The Apps
> In this course you will deploy TF Lite models in various apps including:

    * Cats vs. Dogs: An app that classifies images of cats and dogs.
    * Image Classification: An app that continuously classifies whatever it sees from your device's back
    camera.
    * Objection Detection: An app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and classes) in
    the frames seen by your device's back camera.
    * Speech Recognition: An app that recognizes the words you say.

> You can find all the apps for this course in this [Zip
file](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/September/5d8e8cb3_tflite-apps/tflite-apps.zip).
> Once you unzip the file you will find the folders containing the corresponding apps for each
> lesson. We will also provide links to the individual apps later in each lesson.
